## Workshop Summary: Getting Started with KiCad for PCB Design

In this workshop, you will learn the fundamental steps to get started with KiCad, a powerful tool for designing printed circuit boards (PCBs). The workshop will cover the following key topics:

1. **Downloading and Installation**: You'll learn how to download KiCad and install it on your Windows computer, ensuring you have the right software to start PCB design.

2. **Creating a New Project**: You'll discover how to create a new project, set up a schematic, and organize your work effectively.

3. **Adding Components**: You'll learn how to add electronic components to your schematic, including resistors, switches, LEDs, and batteries, and arrange them in your design.

4. **Wiring Components**: We'll guide you through the process of connecting the components with wires, ensuring proper connections for your circuit.

5. **Assigning Footprints**: You'll understand how to associate real-world footprints with your schematic symbols, a crucial step for designing PCBs accurately.

6. **Error Checking**: You'll explore how to perform error checks to identify and resolve issues in your design, ensuring it's ready for PCB layout.

7. **PCB Design**: We'll introduce you to PCB layout, where you'll transfer your schematic into a physical board, positioning and connecting components effectively.

8. **Board Outline**: You'll create a board outline, defining the shape and dimensions of your PCB.

9. **Routing**: Learn to route connections on your PCB, ensuring electrical connectivity between components while adhering to good design practices.

10. **Final Review**: We'll show you how to review your PCB design and visualize it in 3D to ensure it meets your project requirements.

By the end of this workshop, you will have acquired the foundational knowledge and practical skills needed to begin designing your own PCBs using KiCad. Whether you're a beginner or have some experience, this workshop will set you on the path to creating functional and well-designed circuit boards for your projects.
