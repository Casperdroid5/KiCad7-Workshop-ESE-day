2. **Creating a New Project:**
   - Discover how to set up a new project, schematic, and organize your work efficiently.

3. **Adding Components:**
   - Learn to add electronic components to your schematic, arranging resistors, switches, LEDs, batteries, etc., in your design.

4. **Wiring Components:**
   - Guidance on connecting components with wires to ensure proper circuit connections.

5. **Assigning Footprints:**
   - Understand the association of real-world footprints with schematic symbols for accurate PCB design.

6. **Error Checking:**
   - Explore how to perform error checks to identify and resolve issues in your design.

7. **PCB Design:**
   - Introduction to PCB layout, transferring your schematic into a physical board effectively.

8. **Board Outline:**
   - Learn to create a board outline, defining the shape and dimensions of your PCB.

9. **Routing:**
   - Understand the process of routing connections on your PCB while adhering to good design practices.

10. **Final Review:**
    - Learn how to review your PCB design and visualize it in 3D to ensure it meets your project requirements.

### Outcome:
By the end of this workshop, you will have acquired the skills needed to begin designing functional and well-organized circuit boards for your projects.

## Advanced Workshop:

Ready to elevate your KiCad proficiency? The Advanced Workshop takes you deeper into advanced techniques and features in both the schematic and PCB editors.

### In Schematic Editor:

1. **Personalization:**
   - Add a personal touch by including your name on the schematic paper.

2. **Text Annotations:**
   - Utilize the text feature to include useful information, enhancing clarity and documentation.

3. **Advanced Schematic Organization:**
   - Master hierarchical sheets for a more organized and modular approach to complex designs.

4. **Netlabels:**
   - Use netlabels effectively to simplify and streamline schematic connections.

5. **Library Management:**
   - Explore importing components from external libraries for expanded options and design flexibility.

### In PCB Editor:

1. **Aesthetics and Customization:**
   - Learn to round off PCB corners for a professional look.

2. **Silkscreen Additions:**
   - Add a .bmp logo file and incorporate text for detailed PCB information.

3. **Symbolic Additions:**
   - Enhance the visual representation with useful symbols like polarity indicators.

4. **Advanced PCB Features:**
   - Create custom holes for unique features and add missing 3D models for a comprehensive view.

### Extra Enhancements:

1. **Library Integration:**
   - Explore parts/library integration for a broader range of electronic CAD symbols and models.

2. **KiCad Add-ons:**
   - Discover and leverage downloadable add-ons to enhance your KiCad experience according to your project requirements.
